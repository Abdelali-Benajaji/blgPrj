    <h3>This is How cosMITIK can Rejuvenate 
       your Appearance...</h3><br/><br/>
    <p>I know that skincare is a lot of work and sometimes it can be difficult 
       to find the right ingredients for your skin.</p>
    <h4>So are you ready to get the smooth, healthy skin you've always wanted?</h4><br/><br/>
    <p>I'm here to tell you about an ingredient that will make your skin look
      younger, clearer, and more beautiful than ever before.</p>
    <p>cosMITIK has been valued for its healing properties since ancient
      times and today we'll tell you all about them.</p>
    <p>cosMITIK is extracted from natural ingredients and was praised 
      by the ancient Egyptians and Mayans for its healing properties.</p>
<p>cosMITIK is a fantastic addition to any skin care regime, 
      especially when it comes to anti-ageing.</p><br/><br/>

    <h5>Hydrates & fades the look of scars</h5><br/><br/>
    <p>cosMITIK can lock in moisture and your skin can easily absorb it.
    <br/><br/>
        cosMITIK contain fatty acids that strengthen the barrier of the skin
        layers and retain the moisture inside.
        <br/><br/>
        They work wonders in minimising the appearance of acne scars as well.
        <br/>
        The healing properties of cosMITIK also help improve the skin's texture.</p>
        <br/>
    <p>Continued use of products containing cosmetic assists in counteracting 
        the effects of negative external factors, and keep cell walls strong so they
        can retain moisture and prevent water loss.</p><br/>
    <h5>cosMITIK properties</h5><br/><br/>
    <p>The skin needs collagen to be firm and elastic, and as we get older
       collagen production decreases.
       <br/><br/>
       As cosMITIK is rich in vitamins A and C, it supports collagen production.<br/>
       <br/>
        The fatty acids in cosMITIK  are easily absorbed by the skin, allowing the
        vital antioxidants in cosMITIK  to penetrate the deeper layers of the skin.
        <br/><br/>
        This is also important for cell regeneration, which helps to heal and 
        minimise the appearance of fine lines.</p>
    <p>These compounds help to brighten the skin and reduce signs of
        damage such as hyperpigmentation.
        <br/><br/>
        Studies have shown that cosMITIK effectively reduces fine lines caused
        by UV damage and hyperpigmentation from scars.</p>

        <br/><br/>
    <p>cosMITIK is a lipid-rich oil that's been shown to support the health of 
        the skin's natural barrier.
        <br/><br/>
        The skin barrier prevents the skin from losing moisture and protects the
        skin from bacteria.
        <br/><br/>
        If you have sensitive, irritated or dry skin, it's important to keep your skin
        barrier healthy.
        <br/><br/>
        The fatty acids and antioxidants in rosehip oil help to keep the skin
        barrier healthy</p>
