    <h4 style={style1}>Part 5/5 of the secrets to keeping your skin youthful and
     radiant series</h4><br/><br/>
    <p>Hiya! This is the last blog post in the series "The Secrets to Keeping Your
      Skin Youthful and Radiant". </p><br/>
    <p>And today I'll be telling you about the one serum that provides all the care
      and pampering your skin needs to combat the factors of premature aging
       leaving you with a radiant and youthful complexion. </p><br/><br/>
    <p>So without further ado, introducing the game-changing..</p><br/><br/>
   <h3>Rose Youth Elixir</h3><br/><br/>
   <p>Rose Youth Elixir is an anti-aging serum, specifically formulated to target
      all four major causes of skin aging in one highly concentrated, all-
      botanical blend.</p><br/><br/>
 <p>We previously learned that as we age, our skin is subject to damage from
 sun exposure, lack of hydration, air pollution, and reduced collagen
  production. </p><br/><br/>
  <p>In fact, <h4 style={style1}>these four factors are responsible for 87% of the visible signs
      of aging</h4>. The Rose Youth Elixir addresses each of these concerns with its
       unique blend of powerful, natural ingredients.</p><br/><br/>
 <p>One of the key ingredients in the Rose Youth Elixir is Bakuchiol, a plant
-derived alternative to Retinol. </p><br/><br/>
    <h4 style={style1}>Bakuchiol</h4><br/><br/>
    <li>Boosts collagen and elastin production</li><br/>
    <li>Reducing photo-aging such as fine lines and wrinkles</li><br/>
    <li>Unlike Retinol, it has no harsh side effects on the skin</li><br/>
    <li>Suitable even for sensitive skin types.</li><br/>
    <p>To restore hydration, the Rose Youth Elixir contains a special blend of
      Hyaluronic acid molecules with extremely low weight. </p><br/><br/>
    <h4 style={style1}>Hyaluronic Acid</h4><br/><br/>
    <li>Penetrates deep into the skin to significantly increase moisture
      retention and prevent dryness</li><br/>
     <li>Leaves your skin feeling firmer and more supple over time.</li><br/>
    <p>In addition to Bakuchiol, the serum also includes Rosa Damascena,
      known for its powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.  </p><br/><br/>
    <h4 style={style1}>Rosa Damascena</h4><br/><br/>
    <li>Fights the free radicals that are prematurely aging your skin</li><br/>
    <li>Is an excellent emollient for moisturizing dry skin</li><br/>
    <li>Can be beneficial in treating acneic and scarred skin.</li><br/>
    <h4 style={style1}>Lactic Acid</h4><br/><br/>
    <li><li>Gently exfoliates the skin revealing fresher complexion</li><br/></li><br/>
    <li>Speeds up the skin cell turnover and thus promotes collagen production </li><br/>
    <li>Improves the texture of your skin without causing irritation</li><br/>
    <p>To restore hydration, the Rose Youth Elixir contains a special blend of
      Hyaluronic acid molecules with extremely low weight..</p><br/>
