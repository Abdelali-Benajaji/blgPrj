    <h3>Hidden Advantages of Prebiotics for Healthy Skin...</h3><br/>
    <h5>Prebiotics for your skin? How would that even work?</h5><br/>
    <p>You may be familiar with probiotics, the beneficial bacteria that offer
         immense skin benefits.</p>
    <p>But prebiotics also play an important role when it comes to your skin's
         health..</p>
    <p>Although prebiotics used to be mostly consumed orally, there's now
         growing evidence of the fascinating results of using them topically.</p>
    <h5>So what are prebiotics?</h5><br/>
    <p>Think of prebiotics as a food source for the microbiome that lives on
         your face and is responsible for keeping your complexion healthy and
          youthful.</p>
    <p>A strong barrier provides protection from UV damage, environmental
         damage and other negative influences.</p>
    <p>Let's get into the benefits now.</p>

    <h5>Prebiotics strengthen your skin barrier</h5><br/><br/>
    <p>Prebiotics maintain a healthy balance of the bacteria in the skin
         microbiome that strengthen your skin barrier, encouraging its ability to
          shield your complexion.</p>
        <br/>
    <p>Continued use of products containing cosmetic assists in counteracting 
        the effects of negative external factors, and keep cell walls strong so they
        can retain moisture and prevent water loss.</p>
    <h5>Prebiotics soothe the skin</h5>
    <p>Prebiotics have soothing properties that help to calm irritated skin.
       <br/><br/>
       Also, if you have rashes, irritation and redness, prebiotics will provide
        relief.<br/>
       <br/>
       Prebiotics also help maintain a healthy pH balance on the skin, as well as
        a robust barrier against inflammatory intruders.
        <br/><br/>
        They also feed your naturally occurring probiotics, keeping your skin's
         microbiota strong and healthy.</p>
    <p>The skin's equilibrium is restored, and natural, healthy flora returns to the
         surface, forming a robust barrier that can withstand a range of stresses.

        <h5>Prebiotics support collagen production</h5><br/><br/>
    <p>Collagen levels drop with age, but we can assist our cells to retain
         moisture while maintaining a healthy bacterial balance by using products
         containing prebiotics.
